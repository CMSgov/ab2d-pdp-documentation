# Welcome to the AB2D Documentation repo

In this repository you will find documentation related to accessing production and retrieving real claims data using the AB2D (Claims Data to Part D Sponsors) API. Please read the documentation thoroughly as small variations such as a missing space or missing quote can prevent the the scripts from running properly. When using production, the clients have the ability to download PII/PHI information. You should therefore ensure the environment in which these scripts are run is secured in a way to allow for storage of PII/PHI. Additionally, when used in the production environment the scripts will require use of your production credentials. As such, please ensure that your credentials are handled in a secure manner and not printed to logs or the terminal. Ensuring the privacy of data is the responsibility of each user and/or organization.

## Sample Client Repos

The sample client repos may be referenced in this documentation can be found below:
* [Python Sample Client](https://github.com/CMSgov/ab2d-sample-client-python/)
* [Bash Sample Client](https://github.com/CMSgov/ab2d-sample-client-bash/)
* [Powershell Sample Client](https://github.com/CMSgov/ab2d-sample-client-powershell/)

It is important to note that the AB2D team does **not** regularly maintain the sample clients. Additionally, a best-effort was made to ensure the clients are secure but they have **not** undergone comprehensive formal security testing. Each user/organization is responsible for conducting their own review and testing prior to implementation
